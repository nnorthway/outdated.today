### about
this was built so I could learn about react and fulfill a promise I made many moons ago. it's buit on react (obviously) and uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io), [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com), [Elastic Email](https://elasticemail.com/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). It's hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and I bought the domain on [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) because they're pretty okay at selling me domains. 

this was my first unguided shot at building a react app and i think i did kinda okay. don't roast me too hard though thanks. 

### contributing in other ways
